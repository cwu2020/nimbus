Nimbus is a distributed high performance mobile cloud computing engine.
An alternative to expensive cloud services like AWS, we enlist a network of idle iPhones to perform computing tasks.

Why Nimbus?
- Reliability
	Because of the distributed nature of our compute power, we don't rely on localized servers or data centers, which are vulnerable both to attack and to natural disasters.
- Speed
	Distributed computing systems typically suffer from interruption due to inability to predict idleness. Our propriety scheduler handles this by periodically hashing compute progress to a database and reassigning those tasks to optimal nodes in the case of interruption.
